# Copy-Move-Detector


## Discription
This tool helps you to detect image forgery using the SIFT algo, and this is an easy GUI app which will detect and show the abnormalities present in the image. 


## Working Principle

Image forgery means manipulation of the digital image to conceal some meaningful or useful information of the image. There are cases when it is difficult to identify the edited region from the original image. The detection of a forged image is driven by the need of authenticity and to maintain integrity of the image.
The most frequently used technique for image tampering is copy-move which aims to hide or manipulate the content of the image. This paper surveys the different approaches applied for detecting copy-move forgery.

The image forgery approaches are basically classified into two types namely active and passive approaches. Both approaches use different techniques, and they are classified further which is shown in Figure.

## Detection Results and Comparison

Here we are considering the most used techniques, copy-move and Splicing method, where we have done analysis on some images which we have forged using the copy-move method only.
There are many softwareâ€™s and websites available to change the pixels, width, frames, depth detailing inside a picture. Every software makes changes inside the original picture which can be easily detected by the tampering done to it. There are many existing ways to check the authenticity of an image. We are using copy-move method for the detection, below are some examples of the result.
